# dtools

A modern-day era docker client with some extra features.

More doc to follow.... for now what matters is that the output has been changed a bit from the official client.

Also, added features:
- docker registry management: you can select a default registry where most commands will be run against
- commands to list images in default registry
- commands to list tags of a given image
